With the release of [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-20-04-lts-arrives) the Ubuntu Server Guide has received a major set of updates and has moved to a new location on the [Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs)! The new locations makes it much easier to read and contribute improvements. There is a link on the bottom of each page that points directly to the corresponding Discourse page which contains the source for each page of the Ubuntu Server Guide.

Established Discourse users can edit the pages directly, while new users can make comments on the page with questions or issues that they find. There is no need to check out source files or learn new file formats, just directly edit easy to read Markdown text in the web browser.

The move to hosting the source on Discourse has allowed for much faster updates to the Ubuntu Server Guide to keep it more accurate. When changes are made to the Discourse topics, the changes are reflected on the live Ubuntu Server guide immediately! Moreover, users can download an offline version of the Ubuntu Server Guide from the main page.

We would like to thank the community and the Ubuntu Server team for all the time and effort spent on moving documents to the new system, verifying and updating pages, and adding new content.
