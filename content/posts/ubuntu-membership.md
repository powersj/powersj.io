I ended 2017 with becoming an official [Ubuntu member](https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2017/12/07/%23ubuntu-meeting.html#t20:19). Getting my membership was something I wanted to do for a while; the hardest part of which was getting my [application](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/powersj) all together. I recommend it to anyone who has contributed to Ubuntu for an extended period of time and is still not a member. For folks looking for an open source project to contribute to, have a favorite software that you would like to package up, or interested in other areas like testing or translations I also suggest getting involved!

Along with the new year, I migrated my blog from Jekyll to Hugo. This year I hope to have more posts about topics I am working on and side projects I am spending time on.

Onward and upward to 2018! Happy New Year!
