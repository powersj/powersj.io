# Overview

At the beginning of March, the engineering teams of Canonical met in Budapest, Hungary to work out the final open items for Bionic and begin laying out what comes after the upcoming Bionic release.

## SRU Team

## Bug Triage

## Coding Days

During the week we had a couple opportunities to be heads down. I primarily focused on getting testing going on package builds to prevent FTBFS. As we discussed as a team during the last sprint in NYC, there are more and more reported cases of packages getting uploaded as a part of a support release update (SRU) that in turn break the build of that package or other packages.

I also spent some time on jenkins-launchpad-plugin and submitted two merge requests. First was to have the ability to land git based projects. The second the ability to ignore a commit or description message. This was at the request of the git-ubuntu developers who sometimes subit a merge purely to run it against the official project CI.
