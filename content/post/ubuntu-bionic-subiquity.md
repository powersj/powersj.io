# Subiquity

For this week's [test blitz]({% post_url 2017-11-30-bionic-test-blitz %}), I took the new server installer, subiquity, for a spin.


## Use Subiquity

If you have not already, it would be asked, if you could give Subiquity a try! If you have a favorite virtualization software or custom disk setup that you use then making sure it works before Bionic is released is important.

You can get the latest the latest ISO at the download link below and file any bugs you come across as well.
