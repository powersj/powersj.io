This is an update to my [previous battlestation](TODO) post with what has changed since 2016. This update comes with a few major upgrades: a 4K screen, latest graphics, and NVMe storage.

Ones 'battlestation' is how someone's desktop is setup and configured. One of the most interesting things I like to ask other developers is what his or her workstation is and how it is setup. My curiosity stems from wanting to know what hardware and tools people have found useful and how they have found ways to or not to develop faster and better.

## Desktop

First, the desktop itself:

Here are the specs on my current system that I built in 2012:

* TODO

This system cost me $1,300 at the start of 2017 and has lasted me since with no issues. I have VMs, containers, played games, and even played with GPU learning and mining and it has lasted every step of the way.

Unless I have a part failure, I do not see a need to upgrade the system until sometime in 2022.

## Monitor

Of course without a monitor to interface with the battlestation is useless.

### The Monitor

TODO

![LG 32" 4K LCD](/img/projects/battlestation/TODO "monitor")

While I said this last time, I plan on keeping this format for sometime to come. It is by far my favorite and most productive setup I have ever had. I prefer the less wide screen and additional pixel counts. LG does have a widescreen 4K monitor that would have increased the pixel count, while keeping the format similar to my existing widescreen, but I did not like the amount of head turning. It really annoyed me and caused me to have terrible posture.

### History

I have had a rather lengthy and mixed history of LCD monitors. From earliest to most recent:

* Generic 15" LCD (2004)
* Dell 20" Widescreen LCD 2005WFP (2005-2007)
* Dell 27" Widescreen LCD 2702WFP (2007)
* 2x Dell 27" Widescreen LCDs 2702WFP (2007-2009)
* HP 30" Widescreen LCD LP3065 (2009-2013)
* 2x HP 24" Widescreen LCDs LP2465 (2013-2014)
* LG 34" Widescreen LCD 34UM95 (2014-2018)
* LG 32" 4K LCD (2018-current)

### Learning's

Things I have learned with all these setups:

* I like widescreen LCDs, but I love TODO format of 4K
* I like having one screen in front of me
* I dislike the 16:10 ratio like that found on the 20" and 30" LCD
* I dislike boarders on LCDs
* Having to turn my head too far to the left or right is annoying

## Ubuntu

Of course no battlestation is complete without an operating system to make the hardware work. My choice of OS is of course Ubuntu. Generally I try to run the latest development release on my desktop. Driver support is usually not a problem and I like to try to use the latest software and file bugs for issues I run across.

I still use the default window manager, GNOME, but have considered using i3 or something similar. I think if I wanted to make such a change I need to just do it and try to learn with it.
