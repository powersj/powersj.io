# Ubuntu Server Testing Blitz

As we are on the road to the next Ubuntu LTS, Bionic Beaver, I have decided to start doing what I am referring to as a testing blitz: a semi-weekly test deep dive into a particular topic, functionality, component, or software that is relevant to Ubuntu Server. This will involve quickly learning about the item under test, using, testing, filing bugs, and at the conclusion of the blitz document my learnings in as a post here.

## List of Blitz

Here is what is planned thus far:

* [Using Netplan on Ubuntu Bionic]({% post_url 2017-12-01-bionic-netplan %})
* Ubuntu Bionic Server ISO
* Ubuntu Bionic Server Live ISO
