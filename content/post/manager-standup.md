# Managing: Running Standups

Stand up is essential time set aside each day for the team to come together and update each other on their status, share information, and probably most importantly aid in seeking help, unblocking each other. When done right it enables an all remote team to keep each other progressing on tasks and enstills comradery between team members. Done wrong and it turns into a manonitious, waste of time.

# Attendees

The first step is ensuring the correct set of attendees. The entire team does not need to attend standup by default. Having smaller more focused standups allow for focused time betweeen those who need it. Having too many people there results in people ignoring what is going on.

# Methodoogy

If you are not doing this in person, then pick your favorite video conferencing system. Doing this via chat or some form of text based is not fast enough. Text based communication adds to much latency.

In terms of order, it helps to have the newest person on the team go first at least for their first few months. They will have more to say and ask and I would much rather have them break a few rules and get the help they need to be effective then push them to the end.

In all other cases, the last person to show up goes first and once done, picks the next person to go. This has the interesting side effect of requiring people to pay attention to who has gone already and who is left.

At the end, the manager can make any announcements or comments that are necessary. The team can then move to parking lot items that require additional time.

# Rules

2 mins each
hands off the keyboard: no email/irc/chat while talking
standup if you can :)
parking lot: longer items, design decisions, debug happen afterwards

# Schedule

Daily. This is time for your team to sync up and keep people moving. The effort required to get a few folks together should be minimal and as such worth the time. For fully remote team members the time is critical to keep people connected and focused.

Trying to do this weekly or less often than daily results in people giving hastily put together summaries that are too short and they forget when they might need help. Being consistent in meeting as a group builds the muscle memory.

# Content

Want each person to fundamentally answer these three questions:

* What did you do since the last standup?
* What are you going to do till the next standup?
* What are you blockers/questions?

With a distributed team, the time frames are not always what you did yesterday and what you are going to do today. For example, employees who are about to log off for the day since they are a their end of day, will talk about what they did today and what they will do tomorrow.

The point of the blockers/questions item is this is your one chance to ask others for help

# What to watch out for

* Saying the same thing 3 days in a row
* Saying they have a question or need help and no one jumps up to help
* Design decisions or bikeshedding
