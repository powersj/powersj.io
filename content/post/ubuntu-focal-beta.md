As [announced](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2020-April/000255.html)
the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) beta images are now available! Those of you
subscribed to ubuntu-server mailing list can clearly see the hard work that has
gone on this cycle to get the latest and greatest software to our users.

Check out the initial [release notes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseNotes)
for more details and please help us by testing the beta version of Ubuntu
Focal! Setting up a test system and upgrading from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic)
as well as trying out the live installer for fresh installs are particularly
important.

The Ubuntu Server live installer, based on subiquity, has a couple new features
I would to highlight. First, initial support for automated installs is
available; checkout the [wiki page](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FoundationsTeam/AutomatedServerInstalls)
for more details. Second, the installer comes with the ability to update itself
to get the latest bug fixes and features. This is a huge addition that makes it
even simpler for users to get the latest features and bug fixes!

I am particularly proud about the new [Ubuntu Server guide](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs).
The team and community are hard at work updating the content for the Focal
release. The new location not only looks fantastic, but makes it much easier
for the community to contribute content.

Finally, if you have any questions or ever have ideas to make Ubuntu Server
even better, please feel free to reach out on the [ubuntu-server mailing list](https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-server)
or make a post on our [Discourse forum](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/server).

Thanks and happy testing!
