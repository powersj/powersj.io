title: "Remote Managing: Feature Planning via Specs"

One of the single best methods of aligning work items is the use of specs. A spec is a document describing that ultimately describes the work items for a particular feature. There may be other parts to it, but the ultimate goal is to record and distribute the actual work required to align on the design and what actually needs to be done.

## No Slides

Just say no to doing this in power point. how many times I have seen planning of architectures laid out in power point.

## Contents

I like to break a spec down into different sections. Not all specs need to cover every single section below, in fact it is encouraged to only include what is required and include something not here if you want to.

Here are some ideas:

* Sign Off
* Summary
* In-Scope Deliverables
* Out-of-Scope Deliverables
* Design/Layout
* Work Items
* Open Questions
* Notes
* References

## Sharing

Once the initial draft is complete it can be shared with any relevant stakeholders: anyone working on developing or testing the feature, leads, management, marketing teams, sales, etc. Getting people to respond to the spec, ask questions, answer questions, and to come to an agreement.

I generally prefer to over share these documents as it keeps entire teams part of the process and gives people a chance to voice concerns.
