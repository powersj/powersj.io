The next development release of Ubuntu, the Cosmic Cuttlefish, was [released yesterday](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2018-October/000237.html)! As the first development release after the 18.04 LTS release, cosmic comes with the first set of new features, later kernel, and other new features.

Some highlights include:

* latest upstream stable kernel 4.18
* LXD is installed as a snap by default
* OpenSSL 1.1.1 support
* New GNOME version (up to 3.30)
* New look and theme (I like the refresh)
* ztsd and lz4 support to enable faster snap load times and boot

With Cosmic's release, Ubuntu now has a release using every single letter of the alphabet. I look forward to development on the first release of 2019! Onward to the next release!
