## Trello Setup

Create private trello board
Create 4 lanes
    What went well
    What did not go well
    What did I learn
    What am I confused by
Enable the Voting Power Up
Create two tags
    needs-review
    action-item

## Running Retrospective

Establish time frame
    Should be the previous sprint
    Remind team of events since then
Send out link to everyone
    Give up to 30 mins to fill out
    Can be shorter or longer
    Watch team and respond
Begin by going through each card
    Go from left column to right column
    Do NOT skip any cards
    If action items are greater discussion is required mark the card with the appropriate tag

## Follow-Up

For all cards tagged with ‘needs-review’ assign a time during the week to further discuss those cards.
For all cards tagged with ‘action-item’ get the item assigned to someone with a specific task. If no clear, action then add ‘needs-review’ and discuss.
