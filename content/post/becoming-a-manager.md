## The Road to Manager

Nine months ago I had the honor of becoming the manager of the Ubuntu Server team at Canonical. When I was in College I feel in love with Ubuntu. It just worked. It was simple to use. My first conference was in 2014 at the OpenStack conference in Atlanta. When Mark Shuttleworth came across the stage and gave his [keynote]() I will admit I was pretty amazed of the cool work Canonical was doing.

When I finished graduate school, I thought why not? Why not try working at this really cool company that works remotely. Faster than I ever thought, I had an offer to join the team of my dreams as the QA lead. In the first six months at Canonical, I traveled to Denver, Colorado, Vancouver, Canada, Bucharest, Romania, and Seville, Spain. It was a whirlwind of travel and a fantastic set of experiences all while I learned more and more about Ubuntu Server and involved myself more in the quality of the distribution.

Fast-forward another year and a half and I was asked to lead the team. Needless to say this was really exciting, but something I needed to think long and hard about. My understanding of management came from what I saw at HP for nearly a decade: meetings, slides, repeat. I left HP partially because that is what my life had become even as an individual contributor.

As an individual contributor at Canonical, I got to work on all sorts of new things, spend time learning new technologies, share my experiences with these new technologies, all while spending very, very little time in meetings or writing slides. It was fantastic.

After thinking about this long and hard I decided I would take up the new role. I was ready for a new challenge, it was an absolute pleasure to even be asked to take up this role, and I wanted to help guide the distribution I loved so much.

## Learning's

While only nine months in, here are some learning's so far:

* My victories are when the team wins. People will tell you that you cannot have anything you deliver in a cycle or program be dependent solely on you. What I don't hear is people remind others that there is a shift in when you are successful. It isn't when you personally knock action items out.

* Not everyone works the same way you do :) It is obvious but I needed to be reminded as I learned to cater my leadership and relationship to each person working for me.

* Two steps ahead. Don't think only about delivering the goal. Think about once that goal is out, what are the next two steps. How will the customer respond? What about upgrades? the entire ecosystem. How do we deliver successfully and what comes next?

* Remote: your time with your people is precious. Make the most of those stand ups. Hands off the keyboard and focus on what is going on.

* Ask, ask, and ask. When do you think this will get done? Do you understand priorities? How can I help? What is troubling you?
