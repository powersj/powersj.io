Hello there!

I currently work at [InfluxData][] as the engineering manager and maintainer of
[telegraf][], [influxctl][], and InfluxDB client libraries.

Previously I spent five years at [Canonical][], the company behind [Ubuntu][].
There I spent most of my time as the Engineering Manager and QA engineer for
Ubuntu Server as well as publishing Ubuntu images to various cloud providers.

I have a master's degree in Computer Science from
[Georgia Institute of Technology][gatech] with a focus in Interactive
Intelligence.

Previous to Canonical, I spent nine years at Hewlett Packard. There I worked on
building HP's own Debian derivative, system bring up of large scale-up x86 and
IA64 systems with Linux, and performance of networking and storage devices.
