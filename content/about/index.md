Hello there!

I currently work at [Chainguard][] as an engineering manager where we build
and publish secure container images and squash CVEs using [Wolfi][].

Previously, I worked at [InfluxData][] as an engineering manager and maintainer
of [telegraf][], [influxctl][], and InfluxDB client libraries.

Before that I spent five years at [Canonical][], the company behind
[Ubuntu][]. There I spent most of my time as the Engineering Manager and QA
engineer for Ubuntu Server as well as publishing Ubuntu images to various
cloud providers.

I have a master's degree in Computer Science from
[Georgia Institute of Technology][gatech] with a focus in Interactive
Intelligence.

Previous to Canonical, I spent nine years at Hewlett Packard. There I worked
on building HP's own Debian derivative, system bring up of large scale-up
x86 and IA64 systems with Linux, and performance of networking and storage
devices.
