Hello there!

I currently work at Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu. I work on the Public
Cloud team, which is responsible for creating and publishing all Ubuntu cloud
images across Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and many other
clouds. Previously, I worked on and managed the Ubuntu Server team.

In 2016, I completed my master's degree in Computer Science at the Georgia
Institute of Technology with a focus in Interactive Intelligence. My first
Machine Learning course opened my eyes to the field of AI and continued to
take course work in big data, machine learning, and knowledge-based AI.

Previous to Canonical, I spent nine years at Hewlett Packard. There I worked on
producing HP's own Debian derivative, system deployment and configuration,
system bring up of large scale-up systems with Linux, and Linux enablement and
performance of networking and storage devices on new hardware platforms.
