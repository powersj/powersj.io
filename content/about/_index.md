Hi, I'm Josh!

I currently work as the Engineering Manager of the Ubuntu Server team at Canonical. The team is of course responsible for the Ubuntu Server distribution, bug triage, server images, and software packaging. Additionally, the team develops the cloud-init, curtin, and Ubuntu Advantage projects.

In 2016, I completed my master's degree in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology with a focus in Interactive Intelligence. My first Machine Learning course opened my eyes to the field of AI and continued to take course work in big data, machine learning, knowledge-based AI, and robotics. Since graduating I have continued to foster my interest in the field through exploring public data sets and working smaller companies through the data science process.

Previous to Canonical, I spent nine years at Hewlett Packard. There I worked on producing HP's own Debian derivative, system deployment and configuration, system bring up of large scale-up systems with Linux, and the Linux enablement of networking and storage devices on new hardware platforms.

My resume is available [here](/resume.pdf).
