Hi, I'm Josh

As of 2016, I work at Canonical on the Ubuntu Server team. At Canonical I spend half my time working on the release team of Ubuntu Server where I help with production of server images, daily bug triage, and software packaging for development and supported releases. The other half of my time is spent on the cloud-init and curtin projects.

Also in 2016, I completed my master's degree in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology with a focus in Interactive Intelligence. My first Machine Learning course opened my eyes to the field of AI and continued to take course work in big data, machine learning, knowledge-based AI, and robotics. Since graduating I have continued to foster my interest in the field through exploring public data sets and working smaller companies through the data science process.

Previous to Canonical, starting in 2007, I worked at Hewlett Packard. There I worked on producing HP's own Debian derivative, system deployment and configuration, system bring up of large scale-up systems with Linux, and the Linux enablement of networking and storage devices on new hardware platforms.

In my spare time, I make an effort to go out on hikes, cycle throughout central Washington, or grab food and enjoy a local cider or beer.

My resume is available [here](/resume.pdf).
