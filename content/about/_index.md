Hello there!

I currently work at [InfluxData](https://www.influxdata.com/) on the
[Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) project.

Previously I spent five years at [Canonical](https://canonical.com/), the
company behind [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/). There I spent most of my time as
the QA engineering and then Engineering Manager for Ubuntu Server. I spent my
last year working on the Public Cloud team, which is responsible for creating
and publishing all Ubuntu cloud images across Amazon Web Services, Microsoft
Azure, Google Cloud and many other clouds.

I have a master's degree in Computer Science from
[Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) with a focus in
Interactive Intelligence.

Previous to Canonical, I spent nine years at Hewlett Packard. There I worked on
producing HP's own Debian derivative, system deployment and configuration,
system bring up of large scale-up systems with Linux, and Linux enablement and
performance of networking and storage devices on new hardware platforms.
