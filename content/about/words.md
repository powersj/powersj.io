## Quotes

```text
When you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than
ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. so create.
```

- Why The Lucky Stiff

```text
All my life I have placed great store in civility and good manners,
practices I find scarce among the often hard-edged, badly socialized
scientists with whom I associate. Tone of voice means a great deal to me in
the course of debate. I despise the arrogance and doting self-regard so
frequently found among the very bright.
```

– Edward O. Wilson

```text
Take risks. Ask big questions. Don't be afraid to make mistakes; if you
don't make mistakes, you're not reaching far enough.
```

– David Packard

```text
The longer I love, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life.
Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than
the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures,
than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more
important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a
company...a church....a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice
every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot
change our past...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a
certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is
play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude...I am convinced
that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it
is with you...we are in charge of our attitudes.
```

– Charles R. Swindoll

```text
It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the
strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them
better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose
face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who
errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without
error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who
knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a
worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high
achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while
daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid
souls who neither know victory nor defeat.
```

– Theodore Roosevelt

```text
Some jobs pay better, some jobs smell better, and some jobs have no
business being treated like careers. But work is never the enemy,
regardless of the wage. Because somewhere between the job and the paycheck,
there's still a thing called opportunity, and that's what people need to
pursue.
```

– Mike Row

```text
Grace is the beauty of form under the influence of freedom.
```

– Friedrich Schiller

```text
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue
that counts
```

– Winston Churchill

```text
If it can be destroyed by the truth, it deserves to be destroyed by the
truth
```

### Food

```text
When you fail all you can do is trash it or eat around the edges the best
you can and know tomorrow you're gonna be hungry again.
```

– Brian Langstrom

### Painting

```text
Color is my day-long obsession, joy and torment.
```

– Claude Monet

```text
The landscape painter must walk in the fields with a humble mind.
No arrogant man was ever permitted to see Nature in all her beauty.
```

– Constable

## Poetry

- [If by Rudyard Kipling][if]
- [Invictus by William Ernest Henley][invictus]

```text
There is a tide in the affairs of men.
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat,
And we must take the current when it serves,
Or lose our ventures.
```

– William Shakespeare , Julius Caesar
